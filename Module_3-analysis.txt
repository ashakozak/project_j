COMPARISON BETWEEN DOMESTIC VS INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL WITHIN AUSTRALIAS AIRPORTS 
AND IDENTIFYING MONTHLY PEAKS 

The reason these 8 airports were selected is because these 8 airports were the only Airports that had complete data from 2000-
2022(August);including the covid affected months and years,in both domestic and international passengers.

CONCLUSIONS

Total Number of Domestic and International passengers per airport from 2000-2022 line graph ananlysis

-It was observed that in both total number  of domestic and international passengers that the most frequeneted 
airports were Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane (in that order). The most plausible reason  for this observation 
is that those cities with the Airports previously mentioned are the most developed cities in Australia based on their
size of population of that state with Victoria being the largest followed by New South Wales and Queensland.
-It was also observed that their was an exponential decrease in the total number of domestic and international passengers across
all airports in the  year 2020 for domestic passengers and the year 2021 for intenrational passengers due to
the COVID-19 pandemic which caused Australia to declare a state of emergency and begin closing its national and international borders.


Comparison of total number of Domestic and International passengers per airport from 2000-2022 bar graph analysis

-The obvious observation made here was the sheer difference between total number of domestic and international
passenegers across all airports frequented, this is due to their being more AUstralians here on their home soil at any given time in comparison
to International travelers, furthermore,Austrlaians would also have a multittude of reasons to be travelling within their home soil in comparison 
to international travellers.

Average Number of Domestic and International passenegers in Cairns and Darwin Airport per month from 2000-2022
stacked bar graph analysis

-Cairns and Darwin  were the only airports  that demonstrated a similar trend of monthly average peaks in the winter months of Australia 
(June-August)in domestic and international passenegers.The highest monthly average number of domestic passengers who frequented Cairns Airport was in the month of July
and for international passenegers it was the month of August. The highest monthly average number of domestic and international
passengers who frequented Darwin Airport was the month of July.The most plausible reason for this could be due to the 
warmer weather in Cairns and Darwin in those months seeing as they are closer to the equator which could have been the major influence.
The weather in Cairns in the winter months has a high of 26 to a low of 17 and the weather in Darwin has a high 
of 32 to a low of 20. Therefore, Australians during these winter months along with international travellers in Australia in those months
could be wanting to escape the colder climates for some warmer weather.
